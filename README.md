The goal of this C++ program is to create a program that will help runners like me to keep track of running data and be able to calculate all of the necessary things for running in one program. There is not a program that I know of that can do all of these functions in one application. I will first have a login menu. If they successfully log in it will continue to the main menu prompting them with 4 choices. Update running data which will allow them to add or delete a run from the rundata.txt file. The second option is the summary which will provide them with the monthly mileage and time they ran. The third option that makes the program different from many other programs is that it will allow them to calculate Vdot and race pace in this one program, so instead of going on the internet to search for these calculators, it will conclude in this program. Vdot calculator will ask them their best performance time and based on that it will provide them with the equivalent performance based on this calculation and what pace they should be training at. The race pace calculator will ask them for their goal time and how long a lap is. Then it will calculate how fast they have to run per lap based on the user input. The final option is the sign-out so a new user can sign in or end the program.
